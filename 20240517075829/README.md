# python `pass` keyword

## Definition and Usage

The pass statement is used as a placeholder for future code.
When the pass statement is executed, nothing happens, but you avoid
getting an error when empty code is not allowed.
Empty code is not allowed in loops, function definitions, class
definitions, or in if statements.

## Example

Using the pass keyword in a function definition:
```python
def myfunction():
  pass

```

Create a placeholder for future code:

```python
for x in [0, 1, 2]:
  pass
```
