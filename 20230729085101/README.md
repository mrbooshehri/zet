# Clear cache file system

The `/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches` file is a special file in the Linux operating system that allows you to control and manage the kernel's behavior related to caching of file system data. It is commonly used for performance tuning and memory management purposes.

By writing specific values to the `/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches` file, you can instruct the kernel to release certain cached data from memory. Here are the possible values and their effects:

- `0`: This value indicates no action. It does not drop any caches.
- `1`: This value instructs the kernel to drop the page cache, which is the cache that holds disk pages in memory for faster access.
- `2`: This value instructs the kernel to drop the inode and dentry caches. Inodes represent metadata of files, while dentries are directory entries used to locate files on disk.
- `3`: This value combines the effects of both `1` and `2` i.e., it drops page cache, inode cache, and dentry cache.

To drop caches, you can write any of these values to the `/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches` file using commands like `echo`. However, note that this action requires administrative privileges, as it affects system-wide caching behavior.

Keep in mind that dropping caches can have an impact on system performance, as it may cause increased disk activity when accessing files that were previously cached. It's generally recommended to only drop caches when necessary for specific performance optimization scenarios.

```bash
sync; echo {1..3} > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
```
