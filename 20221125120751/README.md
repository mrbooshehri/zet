# XY Problem

## What is it?
The XY problem is asking about your attempted solution rather than your
actual problem. That is, you are trying to solve problem X, and you
think solution Y would work, but instead of asking about X when you run
into trouble, you ask about Y.

## The problem

This can lead to frustration by people who are trying to help you solve
the problem because by the time you ask about it, the solution that you
need help with might not have any obvious connections to the problem
that you are trying to solve.

## How to avoid it

To avoid falling into this trap, always include information about a
broader picture along with any attempted solution. If someone asks for
more information, or especially a more specific question, do provide
details. If there are other solutions which you believe will be
suggested and which you've already ruled out, then don't try to avoid
going over them again – instead state why you've ruled them out, as this
gives more information about your requirements and helps others provide
better answers.
