# Hash vs encryption

Hash and encryption are both commonly used methods for secure communication and data storage, but they have different purposes and uses.

Hash is a one-way mathematical function that takes an input (or "message") and returns a fixed-size string of bytes. Hashes are commonly used to check the integrity of data, as even the smallest change to the input will produce a completely different output. Hashes are used in many security protocols, such as password storage, where the original password is not stored, only its hash.

Encryption, on the other hand, is a two-way mathematical function that takes an input and transforms it into an unreadable format, called "ciphertext." To get the original data back, a decryption process is used, which takes the ciphertext and returns the original data. Encryption is often used to protect sensitive information in transit and at rest, as it can prevent unauthorized access to the data.

In summary, hash is used for verifying data integrity, while encryption is used for protecting sensitive data.
