# Domain, subdomain, URL, URI

## Domain
A domain is the part of a URL that identifies a particular website or web page. It is the human-readable address that users type into their web browser to access a website. Domains are organized hierarchically, with the top-level domain (TLD) at the rightmost side of the domain name. For example, in the domain `example.com`, `com` is the TLD, and `example` is the second-level domain (SLD).

## Subdomain
A subdomain is a subdivision of the main domain that can be used to organize and navigate to different sections of a website. Subdomains are prefixed to the main domain with a dot. For instance, in `blog.example.com`, `blog` is a subdomain of `example.com`. Subdomains can be used to separate different sections of a website, such as a blog, shop, or user profiles.

## URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
A URL is a specific type of URI that includes the protocol (such as HTTP or HTTPS), the domain name, and optionally, the path to a specific resource on the web server. It is the full address that you type into your browser to access a web page. For example, `https://blog.example.com/posts/2023` is a URL.

## URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)
A URI is a string of characters that identifies a name or a resource on the Internet. It is a more general term that encompasses URLs, URNs (Uniform Resource Names), and URCs (Uniform Resource Containers). A URI can be used to identify a resource, but it does not necessarily provide a means of locating the resource. A URL, on the other hand, is a type of URI that does provide a means of locating the resource.

## Comparison
- **Domain vs. Subdomain**: A domain is the main part of a URL that identifies a website, while a subdomain is a part of the domain that further categorizes or organizes the website's content.
- **URL vs. URI**: A URL is a specific type of URI that includes the location of a resource on the web. A URI is a more general term that can identify a resource but does not necessarily provide a location.
