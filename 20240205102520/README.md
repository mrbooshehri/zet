# Caching vs Buffering

Caching and buffering are both techniques used in computing to improve
performance, but they serve different purposes and operate at different
levels of the system. Here's a comparison between the two:

## Caching:

- **Definition**: Caching is the process of storing data in a temporary
	storage area (cache) so that future requests for that data can be
	served faster. It involves copying data from slower storage media to
	faster memory.
- **Levels**: There are various levels of caching, including CPU cache,
	disk cache, and application-level caching.
- **Goal**: The primary goal of caching is to reduce the time it takes
	to access frequently used data by keeping a copy close to where it's
	needed.
- **Scope**: Caching can be applied to any type of data, such as files,
	database records, or API responses.
- **Control**: Cache management includes deciding what data to store,
	how long to keep it, and when to invalidate or update it.
- **Examples**: Web browsers use caching to store images and scripts
	locally, reducing the need to download them repeatedly.

## Buffering:

- **Definition**: Buffering is the process of temporarily holding data
	in a buffer before processing it. This can help manage the flow of
	data between systems or components that may have different data rates.
- **Levels**: Buffering can occur at various levels, such as network
	buffering, audio/video buffering, and input/output buffering.
- **Goal**: The main purpose of buffering is to smooth out variations in
	data rate and prevent data loss due to mismatched speeds.
- **Scope**: Buffering is often used in real-time applications like
	streaming media, where maintaining a consistent playback experience is
	crucial.
- **Control**: Buffering size and strategy can affect the quality of
	service; too much buffering can lead to delays, while too little can
	cause data loss or glitches.
- **Examples**: Video players use buffering to ensure smooth playback
	even if the internet connection fluctuates.

In summary, while both caching and buffering involve temporary storage
of data to improve performance, caching focuses on reducing access times
to frequently used data, whereas buffering is concerned with managing
data flow and preventing data loss due to speed differences.
